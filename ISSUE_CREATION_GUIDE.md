# Issue Creation Guide

This guide explains how to create the GitHub issues identified by the AI analysis of Project Ares.

## Files Created

1. **ANALYSIS_REPORT.md** - Comprehensive analysis summary
2. **scripts/issue_generator.gd** - Structured issue data for programmatic creation
3. **This guide** - Manual issue creation instructions

## Issues to Create

The analysis identified **10 critical issues** that should be created in GitHub:

### High Priority (Create First)
1. **Fix Missing Signal Connection for Enemy Kill Experience** - `bug`, `gameplay`, `signals`
2. **Fix WeightedTable Crash When No Items Available** - `bug`, `performance`, `error-handling`
3. **Fix Wizard Enemy Class Hierarchy Inconsistency** - `bug`, `refactoring`, `architecture`

### Medium Priority (Code Quality)
4. **Refactor Enemy Movement Logic to Reduce Code Duplication** - `refactoring`, `code-quality`, `maintenance`
5. **Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants** - `refactoring`, `code-quality`, `maintainability`

### Enhancement Features
6. **Feature: Add Poison Cloud Ability with Area Damage** - `feature`, `gameplay`, `abilities`
7. **Feature: Add Archer Enemy with Ranged Attacks** - `feature`, `gameplay`, `enemies`

### UI/UX Improvements  
8. **Add Audio Feedback for Ability Activation** - `ui`, `audio`, `player-feedback`
9. **Implement Tooltip System for Abilities and Upgrades** - `ui`, `accessibility`, `new-player-experience`

### Performance
10. **Optimize Enemy Targeting Performance in Ability Controllers** - `performance`, `optimization`

## Manual Creation Steps

For each issue:

1. Go to GitHub Issues tab
2. Click "New Issue"
3. Copy the title from the analysis
4. Copy the body content with proper formatting
5. Add the specified labels
6. Assign appropriate milestone if available
7. Submit the issue

## Programmatic Creation

The `scripts/issue_generator.gd` contains structured data that could be used with GitHub API to create issues programmatically. Each issue includes:

- Title
- Labels array
- Formatted body with sections:
  - **Was?** (What is the problem)
  - **Warum?** (Why should it be fixed)
  - **Aufgaben / Akzeptanzkriterien** (Tasks/Acceptance Criteria)
  - **Code-Beispiele** (Code examples where applicable)

## Labels to Create

Ensure these labels exist in your repository:

- `bug`
- `feature` 
- `refactoring`
- `code-quality`
- `maintenance`
- `maintainability`
- `performance`
- `optimization`
- `gameplay`
- `signals`
- `error-handling`
- `architecture`
- `abilities`
- `enemies`
- `ui`
- `audio`
- `player-feedback`
- `accessibility`
- `new-player-experience`

## Expected Impact

Implementing these issues will:
- Fix 4 critical bugs affecting gameplay and stability
- Improve code quality and maintainability  
- Add 2 new gameplay features for better player engagement
- Enhance UI/UX with better feedback and accessibility
- Optimize performance for larger-scale gameplay

## Next Steps

1. Review and create the high-priority bug fixes first
2. Plan implementation sprints for medium-priority refactoring
3. Consider player feedback before implementing new features
4. Monitor performance improvements after optimization
