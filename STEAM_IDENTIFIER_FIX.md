# Steam Identifier Declaration Fix

## Issue Summary
The project was experiencing "Identifier not declared" errors for `Steam` and `SteamMultiplayerPeer` classes when trying to build or run the game. These errors occurred because the code referenced these identifiers without properly checking their availability.

## Root Cause
The Steam integration in Project Ares depends on two key components:
1. **GodotSteam plugin**: Provides the `Steam` singleton for Steam API access
2. **steam-multiplayer-peer addon**: Provides the `SteamMultiplayerPeer` class for Steam networking

When these components are not available (during development or incomplete setup), the code would fail with "Identifier not declared" errors.

## Solution
The fix involved adding robust availability checks throughout the `steam_multiplayer.gd` file:

### 1. Steam Singleton Checks
**Before:**
```gdscript
if Steam.has_signal("lobby_created"):
    Steam.lobby_created.connect(_on_lobby_created)
```

**After:**
```gdscript
if Engine.has_singleton("Steam") and Steam:
    if Steam.has_signal("lobby_created"):
        Steam.lobby_created.connect(_on_lobby_created)
```

### 2. SteamMultiplayerPeer Class Checks
**Before:**
```gdscript
steam_peer = SteamMultiplayerPeer.new()
```

**After:**
```gdscript
if Engine.has_singleton("Steam") and Steam and ClassDB.class_exists("SteamMultiplayerPeer"):
    steam_peer = SteamMultiplayerPeer.new()
```

### 3. Consistent Mock Mode Detection
The `_is_mock_mode()` function properly detects when Steam functionality should be mocked:
```gdscript
func _is_mock_mode() -> bool:
    return not Engine.has_singleton("Steam")
```

## Three Operating Modes
The system now gracefully handles three different scenarios:

1. **Development Mode**: No Steam components available
   - Uses mock Steam functionality
   - Falls back to ENet networking
   - Allows development and testing without Steam

2. **Production Mode**: Full Steam integration available
   - Uses real Steam API for lobbies and friends
   - Uses SteamMultiplayerPeer for networking
   - Full Steam functionality enabled

3. **Partial Mode**: Steam API available but not SteamMultiplayerPeer
   - Uses Steam API for lobby management
   - Falls back to ENet networking
   - Graceful degradation of functionality

## Files Modified
- `scenes/autoload/steam_multiplayer.gd`: Added robust Steam availability checks
- `STEAM_MULTIPLAYER_SETUP.md`: Updated troubleshooting section

## Testing
The fix has been validated with logic tests covering all three operating modes to ensure proper fallback behavior in all scenarios.

## For Developers
To work with Steam multiplayer in development:
1. The system automatically detects Steam availability
2. Mock functionality is used when Steam is not available
3. No additional configuration needed for development
4. Full Steam features require proper GodotSteam setup for production builds
